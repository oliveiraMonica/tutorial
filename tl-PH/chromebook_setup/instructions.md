Pwede kang [lumaktaw sa seksiyon na ito](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/installation/#install-python) kung hindi ka gumagamit ng Chromebook. Kung oo, ang iyong karanasan sa pag-install ay medyo mag-iiba. Pwede mo nang isawalang bahala ang iba mga tagubilin sa pag-install.

### Cloud IDE (PaizaCloud Cloud IDE, AWS Cloud9)

Ang Cloud IDE ay isang kagamitan na nagbibigay sayo ng code editor at pahintulot na makagamit ng gumaganang kompyuter sa internet na kung saan ay pwede kang mag-install, gumawa, at magpagana ng software. Para sa tagal ng pag-aaral na ito, ang Cloud IDE ay magsisilbing *local machine*. You'll still be running commands in a terminal interface just like your classmates on OS X, Ubuntu, or Windows, but your terminal will be connected to a computer running somewhere else that cloud IDE sets up for you. Here is the instructions for cloud IDEs (PaizaCloud Cloud IDE, AWS Cloud9). You can choose one of the cloud IDEs, and follow the instruction of the cloud IDE.

#### PaizaCloud Cloud IDE

1. Go to [PaizaCloud Cloud IDE](https://paiza.cloud/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Click *New Server*
4. Click Terminal button(on the left side of the window)

Now you should see an interface with a sidebar, buttons at the left. Click "Terminal" button to open terminal window with prompt like this:

{% filename %}Terminal{% endfilename %}

    $
    

The terminal will give the computer Cloud 9 has prepared for your instructions. You can resize or maximize that window to make it a bit bigger.

#### AWS Cloud9

1. Go to [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Click *Create Environment*

Now you should see an interface with a sidebar, a big main window with some text, and a small window at the bottom that looks something like this:

{% filename %}bash{% endfilename %}

    yourusername:~/workspace $
    

This bottom area is your *terminal*, where you will give the computer Cloud 9 has prepared for your instructions. You can resize that window to make it a bit bigger.

### Virtual na Environment

A virtual environment (also called a virtualenv) is like a private box we can stuff useful computer code into for a project we're working on. We use them to keep the various bits of code we want for our various projects separate so things don't get mixed up between projects.

In your terminal at the bottom of the Cloud 9 interface, run the following:

{% filename %}Cloud 9{% endfilename %}

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3.6-venv
    

If this still doesn't work, ask your coach for some help.

Next, run:

{% filename %}Cloud 9{% endfilename %}

    mkdir djangogirls
    cd djangogirls
    python3.6 -mvenv myvenv
    source myvenv/bin/activate
    pip install django~={{ book.django_version }}
    

(note that on the last line we use a tilde followed by an equal sign: ~=).

### GitHub

Make a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

### PythonAnywhere

The Django Girls tutorial includes a section on what is called Deployment, which is the process of taking the code that powers your new web application and moving it to a publicly accessible computer (called a server) so other people can see your work.

This part is a little odd when doing the tutorial on a Chromebook since we're already using a computer that is on the Internet (as opposed to, say, a laptop). However, it's still useful, as we can think of our Cloud 9 workspace as a place for our "in progress" work and Python Anywhere as a place to show off our stuff as it becomes more complete.
